## History?

* According to [Derek Collision](http://www.quora.com/Is-vcap-an-alias-of-cloudfoundry-or-its-development-code-name), the project name was "VMWare Cloud Application Platform". As such, on the engineering side there are several references to the acronym **VCAP**. Later you will see environmental variables with this naming scheme (e.g. VCAP_SERVICES) and the Cloud Foundry developer's email list is also named VCAP Dev. The resulting product was, and is, marketed as Cloud Foundry. Also according to this post, the original internal project name was B29 (after a building), which was a common naming pattern also seen at Microsoft and Google.
* This naming history may be in contradiction with other [references](http://www.activestate.com/blog/2014/03/brief-history-cloud-foundry-and-stackato).
